## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the Maintainer email to an active and in-use email.

* The PetfindeR package was archived in early January 2019 due to the Maintainer email being inactive. The email in use had unfortunately been hacked so I deleted it, but I forgot to update the Maintainer email for the PetfindeR package and resubmit. I am hoping to have the PetfindeR package unarchived through this resubmission. The package has been updated to work with the most recent version of R. Thank you and apologies for any inconvenience and my oversight.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 14.04.3 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1, R-devel
