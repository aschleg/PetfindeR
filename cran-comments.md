## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed R6 package from Suggests to Imports which should hopefully resolve the issue of the package not installing during the submission process.
* Edited the URL in the README to not cause a NOTE to occur.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.2
* ubuntu 14.04.3 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2, R-devel
* windows (on appveyor), R 4.0.2
* local Windows 10 64-bit install, R 4.0.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORS, WARNINGS or NOTES.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
