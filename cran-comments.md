## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Edited vignettes to not call remote APIs as credentials are unavailable on remote testing systems.
* Added a reference URL in the DESCRIPTION file to the Petfinder API documentation.
* Edited CRAN package URLs to canonical form.
* Updated the package description in the DESCRIPTION file by adding single quotes around software and 
  API names, as well as adding more information on the Petinder API.
